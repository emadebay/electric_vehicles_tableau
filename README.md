##Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and understand the landscape of electric vehicles (EVs). The dashboard focuses on key metrics such as total vehicles, average electric range, and the breakdown of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). This analysis aims to provide insights into market size, growth, technological advancements, and the market share of different EV types.

Project Objectives

Total Vehicles: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
Average Electric Range: Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge technological advancements and efficiency.
Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of BEVs in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles.
Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of PHEVs in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles.
